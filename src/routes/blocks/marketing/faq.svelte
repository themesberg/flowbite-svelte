            You can use Windster for an unlimited amount of projects, whether it's a personal
            website, a SaaS app, or a website for a client. As long as you don't build a product
            that will directly compete with Windster either as a UI kit, theme, or template, it's
            fine.

            What is the difference between Windster and Tailwind UI?</svelte:fragment

          <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Although both Windster and Tailwind UI are built for integration with Tailwind CSS, the
            main difference is in the design, the pages, the extra components and UI elements that
            Windster includes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Additionally, Windster is a project that is still in development, and later it will
            include both the application, marketing, and e-commerce UI interfaces.

          <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Generally, it is accepted to use Windster in open-source projects, as long as it is not
            a UI library, a theme, a template, a page-builder that would be considered as an
            alternative to Windster itself.

          <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            With that being said, feel free to use this design kit for your open-source projects.

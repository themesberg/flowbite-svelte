This way, you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p> <p>Let's start by including the CSS file inside the <code>head</code> tag of your HTML.</p> <h3>Understanding typography</h3><h4>Type properties</h4> <p>A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique, certain shapes are shared across letters.

It contains tons of predesigned components and pages starting from login screen to complex dashboard. Perfect choice for your next SaaS application.</p> </blockquote> <h4>Code example</h4> <p>A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning or end of a stroke on a letter. Typefaces with serifs are called serif typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of the following:</p> <pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;dl class=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 max-w-screen-md text-gray-900 sm:grid-cols-3 dark:text-white\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"flex flex-col justify-center items-center\"&gt;\n  &lt;dt class=\"mb-2 text-3xl font-extrabold\"&gt;73M+&lt;/dt&gt;\n  &lt;dd class=\"text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\"&gt;developers&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"flex flex-col justify-center items-center\"&gt;\n  &lt;dt class=\"mb-2 text-3xl font-extrabold\"&gt;1B+&lt;/dt&gt;\n  &lt;dd class=\"text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\"&gt;contributors&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"flex flex-col justify-center items-center\"&gt;\n  &lt;dt class=\"mb-2 text-3xl font-extrabold\"&gt;4M+&lt;/dt&gt;\n  &lt;dd class=\"text-lg font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\"&gt;organizations&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/dl&gt;</code></pre><h3>Best practices for setting up your prototype</h3> <p><strong>Low fidelity or high fidelity?</strong> Fidelity refers to how close a prototype will be to the real deal. If you're simply preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text — would be more than enough. But if you're going for more intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with on-brand colors, fonts and imagery — could help get more pointed results.</p> <p><strong>Consider your user</strong>. To create an intuitive user flow, try to think as your user would when interacting with your product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing, considering your user's needs and habits early on will save you time by setting you on the right path.</p><p><strong>Start from the inside out</strong>. A nice way to both organize your tasks and create more user-friendly prototypes is by building your prototypes ‘inside out'. Start by focusing on what will be important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image gallery, and list each element by order of priority. This way, you'll be able to create a prototype that puts your users' needs at the heart of your design.</p><p>And there you have it! Everything you need to design and share prototypes — right in Flowbite Figma.</p>"

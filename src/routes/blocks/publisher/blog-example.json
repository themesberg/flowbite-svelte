If you're simply preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text — would be more than enough. But if you're going for more intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with on-brand colors, fonts and imagery — could help get more pointed results.</p> <p><strong>Consider your user</strong>. To create an intuitive user flow, try to think as your user would when interacting with your product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing, considering your user's needs and habits early on will save you time by setting you on the right path.</p><p><strong>Start from the inside out</strong>. A nice way to both organize your tasks and create more user-friendly prototypes is by building your prototypes ‘inside out'. Start by focusing on what will be important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image gallery, and list each element by order of priority. This way, you'll be able to create a prototype that puts your users' needs at the heart of your design.</p><p>And there you have it!

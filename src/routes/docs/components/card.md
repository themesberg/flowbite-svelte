Use these responsive card components to show data entries and information to your users in multiple forms and contexts such as for your blog, application, user profiles, and more.

## Set up

Import Card in the script tag.

```svelte example hideOutput
<script lang="ts">
  import { Card } from "flowbite-svelte";
</script>
```

## Default card

Use the following simple card component with a title and description. Notice the `href` prop set, as that card is one big `<a/>` element.

```svelte example class="flex justify-center flex-wrap gap-2" hideScript
{#include Default.svelte}
```

## Card with action button

Use the following example of a card element if you also want to have an action button.

```svelte example class="flex justify-center flex-wrap gap-2"
{#include Action.svelte}
```

## Card with link

This example can be used to show a CTA as a link instead of a button inside the card.

```svelte example class="flex justify-center flex-wrap gap-2"
{#include Link.svelte}
```

## Card with image

Use <code>reverse={true}</code> to reverse the position of an image.

You can use the following example of a card element with an image for blog posts, user cards, and many more.

```svelte example class="flex justify-center flex-wrap gap-2"
{#include Image.svelte}
```

If you want to spice up your cards you can use the following card which has its child elements aligned horizontally.

```svelte example class="flex justify-center flex-wrap gap-2"
{#include Horizontal.svelte}
```

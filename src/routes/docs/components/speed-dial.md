Get started with the speed dial component to show a list of buttons or menu items positioned relative to the body in either corner as a quick way to allow certains actions to be made by your users.

## Default speed dial

To initialize a speed dial component you need to wrap the trigger element and the list of items inside an element and use the data-dial-init data attribute on it.

You can use any elment as `SpeedDial` trigger (see the [Custom main button](#custom-main-button) example), but for convenience `SpeedDialTrigger` element is used in the below examples.

<Alert>

**Note!** Default class for speed dial was `fixed end-6 bottom-6`. Now no positioning is set by default.

</Alert>

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include Default.svelte}
```

## Colors

The Speed Dial components accommodate color options ("red" | "lime" | "green" | "teal" | "cyan" | "blue" | "purple" | "pink" | undefined), gradient, shadow, and outline styles. For further information, please refer to **[the Button component](https://flowbite-svelte.com/components/button)** documentation.

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include Colors.svelte}
```

## Square speed dial

Use this example to make the trigger buttonâ€™s style square instead of a full circle. As `SpeedDialButton` is an instance of `Button` we use the `pill` property to achevie the effect.

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include Square.svelte}
```

## Text inside button

This example can be used to show the descriptive text inside the button instead of a tooltip.

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include TextInside.svelte}
```

## Text outside button

Use this example to show the text of each button outside of the speed dial as an alternative style.

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include TextOutside.svelte}
```

## Dropdown menu

This example can be used to show a list of menu items instead of buttons when activating the speed dial.

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include Dropdown.svelte}
```

## Alternative menu

This example can be used to show an alternative style when showing a list of menu items.

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include Alternative.svelte}
```

## A11y

Use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to navigate between buttons or links in the speed dial. Press `ESC` to close it.

## Alignment - Position

Align the speed dial menu items by using property `placement="top|right|left|bottom"`.

Control the main button position using the flexbox utility classes from Tailwind CSS through property `class`.

```svelte example class="relative h-[400px]" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include Position.svelte}
```

## Transition

Since the `SpeedDial` component extends `Popper`, it also supports the `transition` and `transitionParams` props for customizing animations.

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include Transition.svelte}
```

## Triggering

Use the `trigger="click|hover"` attribute of the speed dial component to set which type of action should activate the speed dial: click or hover.

The default trigger type is hover for each speed dial component.

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include Triggering.svelte}
```

The default trigger type is hover for each speed dial component.

## Custom main button

You can change the main button to any element you want.

```svelte example class="relative h-96" hideResponsiveButtons
{#include Custom.svelte}
```

## Component data

The component has the following props, type, and default values. See [types page](/docs/pages/typescript) for type information.

## Typescript types

The following excerpt shows you the full list of TypeScript types and interfaces that are being used with the Flowbite Svelte library that you can leverage when building user interfaces and make your code more reliable and scalable.

<script>
  // TODO: Does not build on the server - need to work on it
  // import Prism from 'prismjs';
  // import 'prism-svelte';
  // import "prismjs/components/prism-typescript";
  // const highlighted = Prism.highlight(TypeList, Prism.languages.js, 'js');

  // Load assets as strings
  import TypeList from '../../../lib/types.ts?raw';
</script>

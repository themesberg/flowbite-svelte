## Typescript types

Enhance the reliability and scalability of your user interface code by leveraging data types. Here's an example of how to use them:

  import { Button, type SizeType } from 'flowbite-svelte';
  export let size: SizeType = 'lg'
```

The following excerpt shows you the full list of TypeScript types and interfaces that are being used with the Flowbite Svelte library.

<script>
  import TypeList from '../../../lib/types.ts?raw';
</script>

<pre><code>{@html TypeList}</code></pre>

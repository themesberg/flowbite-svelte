## Remote Setup

Currently, the Flowbite-Svelte MCP server is only available as a **local (stdio) installation**. There is no hosted remote endpoint available at this time.

### Why Local Only?

The Flowbite-Svelte MCP server is designed to run locally on your machine for several reasons:

- **Privacy**: Your queries and usage patterns stay on your machine
- **Performance**: No network latency for documentation lookups
- **Offline Access**: Works without an internet connection
- **Customization**: You can modify and extend the server for your needs

### Using the Local Version

Please refer to the [Local Setup](/docs/mcp/local-setup) guide to install and configure the Flowbite-Svelte MCP server on your machine.

### Future Considerations

If there's significant community interest in a hosted remote version, it may be considered for future development. For now, the local installation provides the best experience with full access to all Flowbite-Svelte component documentation.

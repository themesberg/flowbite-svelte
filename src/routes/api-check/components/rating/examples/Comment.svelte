  <p class="mb-2 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">This is my third Invicta Pro Diver. They are just fantastic value for money. This one arrived yesterday and the first thing I did was set the time, popped on an identical strap from another Invicta and went in the shower with it to test the waterproofing.... No problems.</p>
